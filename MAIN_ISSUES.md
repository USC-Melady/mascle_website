# Main Issues & Project Goals

The project addresses the fragmented process of connecting students with research opportunities at USC's Machine Learning Center. We aim to create a centralized platform that efficiently matches students with research positions using AI-powered recommendations. The system will streamline the hiring process for faculty while providing students with better access to relevant opportunities, ultimately improving the research position matching process for both parties.

## Primary Challenge
The project addresses the fragmented and inefficient process of connecting students with research opportunities at USC's Machine Learning Center. Currently, students and faculty lack a centralized, reliable platform for research position matching, leading to missed opportunities and increased administrative overhead.

## Key Research Questions
1. How can we create an efficient, automated system for matching student skills with research position requirements?
2. What role can AI and machine learning play in improving the accuracy of research position recommendations?
3. How can we streamline the process of resume processing and skill extraction for better matching?

## Project Goals

### For Students
- Provide a reliable, centralized platform for discovering research opportunities
- Implement intelligent job matching based on skills and interests
- Reduce the time and effort spent searching for relevant positions
- Ensure better alignment between student capabilities and position requirements

### For Faculty
- Create an efficient system for posting and managing research positions
- Automate the initial screening of potential candidates
- Facilitate better connections with qualified students
- Reduce administrative overhead in the hiring process

### Technical Goals
- Develop a scalable, maintainable platform using modern web technologies
- Implement robust security and role-based access control
- Create an intuitive user interface for both students and faculty
- Ensure reliable and accurate resume processing and matching algorithms

## Expected Outcomes
1. Improved matching accuracy between students and research positions
2. Reduced time-to-hire for faculty members
3. Enhanced visibility of research opportunities for students
4. Streamlined administrative processes
5. Better alignment between student skills and position requirements
