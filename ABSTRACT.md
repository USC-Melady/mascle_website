# Abstract

This project addresses the challenge of efficiently matching students with research positions and provides a central platform for students and faculty to search and post jobs at the USC Machine Learning Center. The platform leverages modern web technologies (React 18, TypeScript, AWS Amplify) and advanced AI capabilities, featuring a sophisticated resume processing pipeline using AWS Textract and Comprehend, and a content-based recommendation system with BERT embeddings. The system implements role-based authentication supporting multiple user types (Admin, Professor, Student) and utilizes AWS services including Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and S3 for scalable, serverless operations. The platform demonstrates improved matching accuracy and reduced administrative overhead, showing enhanced visibility of research opportunities and better alignment between student skills and position requirements. The system's modular design and comprehensive testing framework ensure maintainability and reliability, while the intuitive user interface facilitates seamless interaction between students and faculty members.
